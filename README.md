This is a bash script to download and run the latest Firefox 64 bit for Linux.
The script created for the Turkish version of Firefox. If you want to use Firefox for other languages you just need to replace the download link with your choice.
This script is tested on my pc and it worked. Almost Linux distros comes with Firefox ESR. ESR is generally enough but some latest features doesn't included with it. So if you want to use the non-ESR version you should just run this script.
You can freely edit and share this script. I'm happy for doing something can run successfully. I hope it will run on your device successfully too :D Enjoy with it.
